# Stopwatch App (React + RxJS)

The App calculates time in format of "hh:mm:ss" and has buttons like this:

1. Start/Stop - start / stop timing, stops and resets the timer.
2. Wait - works on double click. The timer stops timing; if after press Start, then resumed the count.
3. "Reset" - resets the stopwatch to 0.
